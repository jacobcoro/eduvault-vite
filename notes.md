figure out as soon as possible what where the problems I was having with the matrix-crdt library. To that end, I should first get that functionality into the app, and worry about the styles, note taking stuff, etc later.
I should set up e2e testing, and constantly push to production and test the production build after every major change, so I don't run into my previous problems with the production build, and have trouble figuring out which commit broke it.

todo:

- [ ] login form
- [ ] pull in database class
- [ ] styles. keep using css modules like in the next app.
- [ ] nav bar
- [ ] dark mode toggle.
- [ ]
